# Searchsploit 

* It's a tool that checks exploitDB for exploits on different pieces of software.

*  Sometimes versions are tricky in exploits. So make sure you check that the exploit is for the right version of software. 

* To view the exploits code we can use this command `searchsploit -x [EXPLOIT PATH]`.  
*  Copies the exploit code to my working directory `searchsploit -m [EXPLOIT PATH]`.    

* `/usr/share/exploitdb/exploits`
* ExploitDB's exploits are saved in this path.
