### <span style="color:#009688"> Found a `.git` Directory  

* We open the `.git/HEAD` directory which should have a reference to a `master` file `.git/refs/heads/master` which points to the object that stores the directory tree. Then we examine the tree object and open it's contents to find out what is the nature of all the other objects.

## <span style="color:#009688">Normal Usage  
 
* `git show`  could be used to view the git objects.
