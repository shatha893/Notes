# Burp Suite

### The Repeater

* From my own experience:   
	* When catching a request through burp suite we can right click on it and choose "send to repeater" then you can go to the repeater tab and this way you can keep repeating the same request over and over again and the reponse will be shown on each request. Sometimes I want to try multiple different things with the request and see what is the response and the repeater makes it easier.  

	* Try to use the repeater in Burp suite it save sooo much time

### The Intruder   

* Can be used for blind sql injection.
* Guessing web directories.
* tbd: Document how to use it !!!
