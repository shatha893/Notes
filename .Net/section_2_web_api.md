## Model-View-Controller (MVC)  

### Model 
* It's the data.
* The user won't see this code.

### View
* It's what the user sees.
* It's the GUI or UI.
* The model updates the view and the user sees the view.  


### Controller  
* It does the actual work.
* Manipulates the model.
* The user sees the view but uses the controller.

* We can build the model and then controller and then keep jumping between both.
