* Description:   
We made a website that helps students with accessing resources (pastpapers, notes, doctors information, computerized exams). It was a personal struggle that made us think why not make it our graduation project. I programmed the front end of the website using ReactJS and surely HTML and CSS.  

* I've been thinking about what I want to do next and now I know that I love programming and I'm willing to grow my knowledge and experience in this field and I was hoping I could do this through your company
