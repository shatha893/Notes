# <span class="title">Chapter 1 : Networking Today


<span class="date">Monday, 27/6/2021</span> 

<br/><br/>
Networking in the past wasn't like how it is now.  



### <span class="chapter2subs subtitle" style="color:#6495ED"> Network Components  
  1. Hosts.
  2. End Devices.
  3. Intermediary Network Devices.
  4. Network media (wired/wireless).
   
<br/><br/>

### <span class="chapter2subs subtitle" style="color:#6495ED"> Network Representations and Topologies   

* What does *interface* mean?  
  The software that is connected to the physical port.  

* Topology Diagrams can be  
  1. Physical Topology which means how the devices are sorted physically in the network.
  2. Logical Topology.  

<br/><br/>

### <span class="chapter2subs subtitle" style="color:#6495ED"> Common Network Types  

* Depending on the Size 
  1. Small Home Networks. 
  2. Small Office/Home Office (A little bigger than point 1.).
  3. Medium to Large Network. 
  4. World wide networks.  
<br/>
* Depending on the Area  
  1. Local Area Network (LAN) I can make a LAN of my own.
  2. Wide Area Network (WAN) to accomplish a WAN we need an ISP we can't ourselves make a WAN.
  3. Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) is connected on the scope of a city.  
  4. Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN).
  5. Storage Area Network (SAN).  
   

<br/><br/>

### <span class="chapter2subs subtitle" style="color:#6495ED"> Internet Connections  

* What is the *internet* ?  
  It's a service that is added to a LAN after multiple LANs are connected into WANs. ISPs are the ones who connect the LANs and make them into WANs. So, the internet is a bunch of routers connected with each other (ISPs connected with each other).
<br/>

* What do we mean by *intranet* ?  
  Is a network for the company and only for this specific company. Meaning it's a private collection of LANs and WANs. 
<br/>

* What do we mean by *extranet*?  
  Accessing a company's network remotely happens through something called the extranet.
<br/>

* How to get internet connection in your home?  
  1. Using Cable (We don't have this technology in Jordan).
  2. DSL.
  3. Cellular (cell phone towers are used to transmit internet).
  4. Satellite (Is used when the area doesn't have any of the other services available).
  5. Dial-up telephone.  
<br/>

* How to get internet connection in business?  
  1. Dedicated Leased Line.
  2. Ethernet WAN.
  3. DSL.
  4. Satellite.  
   <br/>
* What do we mean by *converging network*?  
  It means that the device the media and everything in the network stays the same but we can send any type of data.  

<br/><br/>

### <span class="chapter2subs subtitle" style="color:#6495ED"> Reliable Network  
We need to have multiple things in our network to make sure it's reliable and these things are:  
1. Fault Tolerance.  
   We need to provide redundancy for our network meaning making a backup for every damn thing.  

2. Scalability.  
   Can expand quickly and easily supports new users.  

3. Quality of Service.  
   Ensure reliable delivery of content for all users.  

4. Network Security.  
   To achieve minimum security for network we need to accomplish the whole CIA Triad.

<br/><br/>

### <span class="chapter2subs subtitle" style="color:#6495ED"> Network Trends 

* Bring Your Own Device - BYOD  
  A person can bring their own device and connect to our network but this person can connect to a specific part of the network.  

* Online Collaboration.  
* Video Communication.  
* Cloud Computing.  
  We have 4 types of clouds (1) Public Clouds (2) Private Clouds (3) Hybrid Clouds (4) Custom Clouds.  

* Technology Trends at home (Smart Homes).  
* Powerline Networking. It transmits data through electricity.  
* Wireless Broadband.
  
  <br/><br/>

### <span class="chapter2subs subtitle" style="color:#6495ED"> Network Security  

* We always have threats on our network whether it was internal (most dangerous) or external.
* Examples on External Threats:  
  1. Viruses (Their files are always executables ".exe").
  2. Worms (It spread all over the network).
  3. Trojan Horses (It appears as sth but it actually is sth else which is usually mallicious).
  4. Sypware and adware (The most innocent type of threat).  
  5. Zero-day attacks.
  6. Threat Actor Attacks (Black hats, white hats or gray hats).
  7. Denial of Service Attacks (DoS).
  8. Data Interception and theft.
  9. Identity theft.  
<br/>

* Examples on Internal threats:  
  1. Lost or stolen devices.
  2. Accidental misuse by employees.
  3. Malicious act by an employee.  
<br/>

* End devices should have antiviruses and antispyware installed on them.
* Firewalls.

<br/><br/>

### <span class="chapter2subs subtitle" style="color:#6495ED">The Network's Component  
1. Source.  
2. Destination.
3. Media.
4. Protocol.  
   A protocol exists so that routers that are not from the same vendor be able to communicate.
5. Message.
6. Intermediate device.  
<br/><br/>

### <span class="chapter2subs subtitle" style="color:#6495ED"> Network Types  

1. Client-Server Network.  
   One or more clients ask for services from the server.
2. Peer-to-Peer Network.  

* When to use each one of them?  
  Not one of them is better than the other. It depends on the application.  
<br/><br/>

### <span class="chapter2subs subtitle" style="color:#6495ED">Types of devices(Sources & Destinations)   
1. End Devices.
2. Intermediary devices.
     * Switch.
     * Router.
     * Hub (LEGACY).
     * Firewall.
     * Wireless Access Point.  
     * Multilayer Switch/ Layer 3 Switch.   
  
<br/><br/>  

### <span class="chapter2subs subtitle" style="color:#6495ED">Media Types  

1. Wired ( More stable of course! ).
   
2. Wireless.  

* Which one to use?  
  Also, it depends on the application.  

<br/><br/>  

### <span class="chapter2subs subtitle" style="color:#6495ED"> Network Interface Card (NIC Card)  

To connect a PC to a switch we use the NIC Card.  
To connect the switch with the network we need the physical port and the interface (which is the software of the switch's port). <<< Same applies to routers    

<br/><br/>  

### <span class="chapter2subs subtitle" style="color:#6495ED">Network Topologies  
1. Physical Topology.  
   How the network is consisted physically.
2. Logical Topology.  
   IP addresses, port numbers and interfaces.  

<br/><br/>  

### <span class="chapter2subs subtitle" style="color:#6495ED"> Network Sizes  
1. Small Home.
2. SOHO (Small Office Home Office).
3. Medium/Large.
4. World Wide (Internet) >>>> Biggest Network in our current time.  

<br/><br/>  

### <span class="chapter2subs subtitle" style="color:#6495ED">Network Types(when looking at the geographic space it takes)  

1. LAN (Local Area Network).  
   A small network.
2. WAN (Wide Area Network).  
   A large network (e.g. Internet).
3. PAN (Personl Area Network).
4. SAN (Storge Area Network).
5. MAN (Metropolitan Area Network).  
   A network with size between the size of a WAN and the size of a LAN.
6. WLAN (Wireless LAN).  

<br/><br/>  

### <span class="chapter2subs subtitle" style="color:#6495ED">Internet  

* No one *owns* the internet there are people that organized stuff related to the internet. 
  
* Extranet is a part of the internet. So what do we mean by it?  
  Is a network specific for a bunch of *companies*.  

* What do we mean by Intranet?  
  It's a network for a specific *company*.  

* How do we connect to the internet?
  1. *Dial up* is an old way of connecting to the internet (through cards).
  2. *ADSL* and *SDSL*. What's the difference between both?  
   ADSL gives me download faster than upload (used at houses) and in SDSL upload is equal to download (used in companies).  
  3. *Dedicated Leaved Line (aka Dark Fiber)* is a cable that is dedicated for a specific user (e.g. in my house we use the internet with all the other people in our neighborhood but when using the dedicated line we have the fiber to ourselves). 
  4. 3G, 4G and 5G.
  5. There's a fifth thing that I didn't catch its name.????? 

<br/><br/>  

### <span class="chapter2subs subtitle" style="color:#6495ED">Converged network (Reliable network)  
Is the ideal network (stable, whole,...etc). Important things to have in such network is:  
  1. Fault Tolerance.  
    The fact that if my network encountered any problem there's a backup plan or literal backup.  

  2. QOS (Quality of Service).  
   To prioritize.  

  3. Security.  
   I don't think we need any description here.  

  4. Scalability.  
   The ability to nkaber the network.  

   <br/><br/>  

### <span class="chapter2subs subtitle" style="color:#6495ED">Cloud Computing (Trending these days)  

(Fun Fact) Only 2% of the devices around the world are connected to the internet.  
(Another Fun Fact) Amazon is responible for 90% of the cloud computing around the world.  
(Third Fun Fact) Under the business park there's something called "Zain Datapark" in Jordan. What does it do? Check the recording I guess

* Types of cloud computing(make sure they're indeed what I wrote they are)  
  1. Hybrid.
  2. Public.
  3. Private.
  4. Custom.  

<br/><br/>  

### <span class="chapter2subs subtitle" style="color:#6495ED">Network Security  

  * How to protect your network?  
    1. Dedicated Firewall for the network.  
    2. Access Control List (ACL).  
    3. Intrusion Prevention System (IPS).  
    4. Anti-virus. 
    5. Virtual Private Network(VPN) when we say vpn we use it to prevent anyone to see the data we're sending through the network.
