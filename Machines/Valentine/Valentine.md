## <span style="color:[COLOR]">Notes During Working on the Machine 🧐🤓   

* The web service `http` uses php for the backend `X-Powered-By: PHP/5.3.10-1ubuntu3.26`.
* Imma try and see if there are any virtual hosts on the service from the https certificate I can get the domain.
* Tried to look for the way of encoding/decoding text into base64 and found a php function (actually two) that does that but I still don't know the exact code.
