* What is a ShellShock?  
     In laymanâ€™s terms, Shellshock is a vulnerability that allows systems containing a vulnerable version of Bash to be exploited to execute commands with higher privileges.

### <span class="helpmach subtitle">Useful Info
   * I will start with the http service.
   * `Cookie: elastixSession=58cepcv54igih0lmia2r61mih6` this cookie gets sent with each request to the http and https.
   * The same cookie is being sent with the request however it was.
   
   * Apache version `Apache/2.2.3 (CentOS) Server at 10.10.10.7 Port 443`. The Apache exploits seem a bit complicated, plus I'm not sure if they'll work.

* <span class="helpmach subtitle">Task 2</span>  
   Looking for exploits on a2billing (because I forgot what I found earlier).
* <span class="helpmach subtitle">Result</span>  
   No exploits on the version we have.  

<br/>

* <span class="helpmach subtitle">Task 3</span>  
    Exploits found on vtiger.
* <span class="helpmach subtitle">Result</span>
1. On the version we have there's LFI that I already used to get the admin's password which was through the php file `graph.php`.  
2. Found some file that has a vulnerability called `phprint.php` it gives me the error message `Error:wrong print link` or something similar. But I honestly didn't understand the entire code of the exploit.
 
<br/>

* <span class="helpmach subtitle">Task 4</span>    
    Trying to find some vulnerability in the webmin webpage.
* <span class="helpmach subtitle">Result</span>  
Nothing so far. 
I found something to do with the password_change.cgi but password changing is disabled plus the exploit is newer than the version on the box.
A webpage says all versions before 1.920 are vulnerable to a remote code excution vulnerability (the password_change one). But it says the option of resetting the password should be on and it's not so I have to forget about it.

<br/>

* <span class="helpmach subtitle">Task 5</span>    
    Find out what this php code means 
    ```

* <span class="helpmach subtitle">Result</span>  
    Yet to be accomplished. 

<br/>

* <span class="helpmach subtitle">Task 6</span>  
   Gobuster the http service.
* <span class="helpmach subtitle">Result</span>   
   Didn't find anything useful.  

<br/>

* <span class="helpmach subtitle">Task 7</span>  
   Trying to exploit the IMAP or the POP3 services.
* <span class="helpmach subtitle">Result</span>   
   Didn't find any exploit on the version we have (2.3.7).  

<br/>

* <span class="helpmach subtitle">Task 8</span>  
   Research exploits for the php version or the phpinfo file we found on the website.
* <span class="helpmach subtitle">Result</span>   
   So far they seem like they're a bit hard to understand to be honest. Too much use of libraries and so little explanation.

### <span class="helpmach subtitle">Why I Got Stuck?  
<br/><br/>

### <span class="helpmach subtitle">Nice Things I Found in Someone Else's Write Up  

* <span class="helpmach">The LFI Exploit</span>  
  1. In the file we were able to get to through this path `/vtigercrm/graph.php?current_language=../../../../../../../..//etc/amportal.conf%00&module=Accounts&action`, instead of just reading it as is I could've opened the source code where it was written in a much more readable way.

  2. I could've logged in as `root` with the admin's password through ssh and BOOM I'll get access to the machine with root privilage also.

* <span class="helpmach">Webmin Exploit</span>  
   1. I had the ability to sign into it also with the admin's credentials. When I tried that it didn't work not sure why, I think I probably pasted the password in a wrong way or sth.
   2. The writeup's author words `Logged in here, I basically own the system. I can change passwords for any user (see image above), schedule crons, install packages, or run commands as any user.`
   3. So how does it give me access to the box?  
   <img src="webmin_shell.PNG">  

* <span class="helpmach">ShellShock</span>  
   1. I've been experimenting with shellshock the wrong way, they used he User-Agent header.
   2. Wherever there's CGI there's shellshock, that's what the writeup states.
   3. It's so simple you just put the following in the User-Agent header `() { :; };[cmd]`, so to try it out they used the command `sleep 10` so a delay would be evident.

* <span class="helpmach">SMTP</span>  
   * What is Swaks in Kali Linux?  
    Swaks is a featureful, flexible, scriptable, transaction-oriented SMTP test tool written and maintained by John Jetmore.  
	
	
* Then to the next machine which is [[Cronos]]
