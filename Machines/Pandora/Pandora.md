## <span style="color:[COLOR]">Notes During Working on the Machine 🧐🤓   

* The "Send Us Message" could be something. 
* Seems like there's a virtual host called `panada.htb`.
* The "send us" is a GET request   
`GET /?fullName=&email=&phone=&message= HTTP/1.1`  

* Is this something to think of as important?  `<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="ud-main-btn ud-white-btn">`
