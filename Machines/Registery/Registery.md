## <span style="color:#9933FF">Notes During Working on the Machine 🧐🤓   

* The http service `-sV` `80/tcp open  http    nginx 1.14.0 (Ubuntu)`.  
* `/install` found it with the gobuster command and it contains pure gebbrish.  
* The web application just loads when provided with `backup.php` and then it opens a blank page. Which means the page exists because I tried some random shit .php and it gave me 404.
