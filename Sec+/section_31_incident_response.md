# Section 31: Incident Response and Forensics  

## Incident Response Procedures  
* Our system will never be 100% secure.
* What is Incident Response?  
  * a set of procedures that an investigator follows when examining a computer security incident. 
* Incident Management Program: a program consisting of the monitoring and detection of security events on a computer network and the execution of proper responses to those security events.
* Basic 6 step procedure looks something like *preparation*,*Identification*, *containment*, *eradication* *recovery* and *lessons learned*.

* Identification: process of recognizing whether an event that occurs should be classified as an incident.  

* Containment: is focused on isolating the incident.  

* Recovery: focused on data restoration, system repair, and re-enabling any servers or neteworks taken offline during the incident response.  

* Lessons Learned Process. Literally what the name says.  

## Forensic Procedures  

* Written procedures: ensure that personnel handle forensics properly, effectively and in compliance with required regulations.   

1. Identification: ensure the scene is safe. Secure the scene to prevent evidence contamination, and identify the scope of evidence to be collected.
2. Collection: ensure authorization to collect evidence is obtained, and then document and prove the integrity of evidence as it is collected. 
3. Analysis: create a copy of evidence for analysis and use repeatable methods and tools during analysis.
4. Reporting: create a report of the methods and tools used in the investigation and present detailed findings and conclusions based on the analysis.  

* Legal Hold: a process designed to preserve all relevant information when litigation is reasonably expected to occur.  

* Forensic analysts have to follow a code of ethics which has 3 codes  

  1. Analysis must be performed without bias.
  2. Analysis methods have to be repeatable by third parties.
  3. Evidence must not be changed or manipulated.
