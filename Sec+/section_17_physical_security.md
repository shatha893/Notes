# Section 17 Physical Security  

## 148. Physical Security  
* If an attacker gets access to a network physically they can take control of its devices.

### Three Main Areas of Physical Security  

1. The Parameter  
* As approaching the building what is in the way of the attacker.  
2. The Building  
* Controls put there to secure the building.  
3. The Room Itself  
* How is the organization keeping unauthorized people outside. 

## 149. Surveillance  

* Closed Circuit TV (CCTV)  
  * Has multiple types. They can be wireless or wired, or indoor or outdoor.
  * Pan Tilt Zoom (PTZ)  
    * Which is a system that can be used with CCTVs.
  * Infrared Systems which can detect objects through heat.  

* Placement is important with Cameras.

## 150. Door Locks  

* We should use locks to keep unauthorized people from entering our organization.
* Don't use padlocks. Instead use keys, pins, wireless signals or biometrics to lock doors.
* Cypher locks can also be used.
* Electronic access system (By authenticating using a badge).  

* In addition to locks we can use **mantraps** which is an area between two doorways that holds people until they are identified and authenticated.  

## 151. Lock Picking (Demo)  

## 152. Biometric Readers  
* Biometrics  
  * Relies on the physical characteristics of a person to identify them.  
* Challenges  
  * False Acceptance Rate (FAR)  
    * Can be solved by increasing the sensitivity of our scanners.  
  * False Rejection Rate (FRR)  
    * Denies authorized user to access the system.  
* Crossover Error Rate (CER)  
  * Which is an equal eeror rate (ERR) where teh false acceptance rate and false rejection rate are equal.
  * We always try to do that.
  * CER measures the effectiveness of a biometric system.
