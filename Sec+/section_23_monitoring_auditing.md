# Section 23: Monitoring and Auditing  

## 

* Automated Monitoring Methods  
  * Signature-based: (Least false positives) Network traffic is analyzed for predetermined attack patterns.
  * Anomaly-based: (average false positives ) A baseline is established and any network traffic that is outside of the baseline is evaluated
  * Behaviour-based: (Most false positives ) Activity is evaluated based on the previous behaviour of applications, executables, and the operating system in comparison to the current activity of the system.  

* In some IDS/IPS systems methods maybe combined into a hybrid approach.  

## 197. Performance Baselining  

* Baselining is the process of measuring changes, in networking, hardware, software, and applications.
* Baseline Reporting is documenting and reporting on the changes in a baseline.
* Security Posture is risk level to which a system or other technology element is exposed.
