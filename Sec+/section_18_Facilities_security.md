  * Special Hazard Protection.

* Don't use water based extinguisher in a server room.  

* Classes of fire we have  
  * class A ( Use water base extinguisher)

    * Flammable gases or liquids
    * Extinguished with a CO2 based fire extinguisher.

    * Laptops have lethuim.
  * class K  
    * Cooking oil.
  
* Two types of sprinklers  
  * Wet Pipe Sprinkler System  
    * Pipes are filled with water all the way to the sprinkler head and are just waiting for the bulb to be melted or broken.

   * Dry Pipe Sprinkler System  
     * Pipes are filled with pressurized air and only push water into the pipes when needed to combat the fire.  

   * We also have the pre-action sprinkler system that will activate if there was smoke in the room and not wait for a bulb to melt.  

* In server rooms we use "Clean Agent System"  
  * Fire suppression system that relies upon gas (HALON, FM-200, or CO2) instead of water to extinguish fire.
