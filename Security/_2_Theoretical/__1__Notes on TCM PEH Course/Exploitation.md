# Exploitation  

## Reverse Shells and Bind Shells  
* Most of the time we will be using reverse shells but sometimes you just need bind shells and reverse shells just won't work so we use bind shells instead.
* We can use bind shells if we want to get a shell on a remote machine that I only have its ip address, I can use a reverse shell in this case somehow but it's not simple.  

## Credential Stuffing and Password Spraying  

* Credential Stuffing  
  * It's like instead of using bruteforce or dictionaries of weak password we use a list of passwords and usernames taken from data breaches.  

* So when we have to brute force a login we mostly create a custom list to the specific client instead of just using an already existing list.
