# Scan and Enumeration  

## Nmap Scan  
* It's best to let the scan run and while it's doing that you can go and do the OSINT on the organization until it finishes.  

## Enumerating HTTP and HTTPS  
* If the website that is hosted shows me the default page this is not, in itself, a vulnerability but it could hint to me that this client has bad security hygeine and that I might find other vulns.  

## Researching Potential Vulnerabilities  
* Take anything you find interesting and put it in your notes. Put the links of the exploits too there so you can get back to them.
