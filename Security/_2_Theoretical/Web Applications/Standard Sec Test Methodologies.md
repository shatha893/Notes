# Web Application Penetration Testing Standard Methodologies  

* Different applications require different kinds of tests and methodologies and that's why penetration testers sometimes create their own methodology from the standard methodologies.  
* These methodologies can be:  
  * OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project)
  * OSSTMM (Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual)
  * PTF (Penetration Testing Framework)
  * ISSAF (Information Systems Security Assessment Framework)
  * PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)

## OWASP's Methodology  

* I 'm guessing it relies on the OWASP top 10. That when I'm testing I should be looking for these 10 most important vulnerabilities that could exist in an application and that it's dangerous if the they do exist.
