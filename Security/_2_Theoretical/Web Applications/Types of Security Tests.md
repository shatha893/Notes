# Types of Security Tests  

* We have types of how to approach a web application and how to test it.  

## 1. Access to Application  
* The test depends on who am I accessing the system with and that depending on who am I accessing the system with I can view different content and have different permissions to different stuff.
* So the testing here would be to login as different types of users to test and see if each user has the right privileges and has the right level of security.  

* So I'm gonna stop right there because turns out security tests are different than Penetration testing where penetration testing turned out to be a part of security tests.
