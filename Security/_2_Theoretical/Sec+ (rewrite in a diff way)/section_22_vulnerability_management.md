# Section 22: Vulnerability Management  


## Vulnerability Assessment  

* Password Analysis  
  * It's a tool to test the strengths of your passwords to ensure your password policies are being followed.
  * A *password cracker* uses comparative analysis to break passwords and systematically continues guessing until the password is determined.
  * Most famous password crackers are *Cain and Abel* and *John the Ripper*.
  * Four different methods for password cracking and analysis  
    1. Password Guessing: Occurs when a weak password is simply figured out by a person.  
    2. Dictionary Attack: Method where a program attempts to guess the password by using a list of possible passwords.
    3. Bruteforce Attack: Method where a program attempts to try every possible combination until it cracks the password.  
    4. Cryptanalysis Attack: Comparinga precomputed encrypted password to a value in the lookup table.  
    5. Rainbow Table Attack: List of precomputed values used to more quickly break a password since values don't have to be calculated for each password being guessed (Crackstation is a rainbow table).
    6. Rubber Hose Method: Attempt to crack the password by threatening or causing a person physical harm in order to make them tell you the password.
