# Section 21: Risk Assessments

## 181. Risk Assessments  

* Def. A process used inside of risk management to identify how much risk exists in a given network or system.  

* Risk is *the probability that a threat will be realized*.  

* Vulnerabilities are *any weakness in the design or implementation of the system.*  

* Threats are *any condition that could cause harm, loss, damage or compromise to our information technology systems*.  
* Threats are external and beyond your control.  

* We try to mitigate those vulnerabilities and threats to try and get the outcome we want.  
* Some threats are outside of our control.
* So what do we do when we identify threats and vulnerabilities?
  * We do something called **Risk Management** which is used to minimize the liklihood of a negative outcome from occuring.

* In any system there are 4 things we can use/do to avoid risks  
  1. Risk Avoidance: A strategy that requires stopping the activity that has risk or choosing a less risky alternative.
  2. Risk Transfer: A strategy that passes the risk to a third party (Most probably to an insurance company).
  3. Risk Mitigation: A strategy that seeks to minimize the risk to an acceptable level.
  4. Risk Acceptance: A strategy that seeks to accept the current level of risk and the costs associated with it if the risk were realized ( It's usually associated with things that have a low cost or the impact of these things on the organization is low)

* Even if we avoid, transfer, mitigate or accept risks there will always be an amount left over and this is what we call **Residual Risk**.  

* To conduct a risk assessment we have to do the following  
  1. Identify assets.  
  2. Identify vulnerabilities.
  3. Identify threats.
  4. Identify the impact.  


## 182. Qualitative Risk  

* In risk assessments we can measure risks in two ways either *Qualitatively* or *Quantitatively*.

* Qualitative analysis uses intuition, experience, and other methods to assign a relative value to risk.  
* Experience is critical in qualitative analysis.
* We need to calculate how highly probable this risk can happen and how much is the impact but in qualitative risk measurement we don't use numbers or a highly complex algorithm we just use experience and judgement.


## 183. Quantitative Risk Analysis  

* Uses numerical and monetary values to calculate risk.
* Quantitative analysis can calculate a direct cost for each risk.
* Magnitude of Impact: An estimation of the amount of damage that a negatie risk might achieve.
