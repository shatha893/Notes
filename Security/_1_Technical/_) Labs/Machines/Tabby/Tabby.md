* Tried a directory that doesn't exist so that I can get the apache version its `2.4.41`.
* The Apache Tomcat vesion is `9` I think. 

* Grabbed the banner of the `p8080` service: 
```
PORT 	STATE SERVICE VERSION
8080/tcp open  http	Apache Tomcat
```  
* Searchsploited the http tomcat with the apache version  
```
Apache Tomcat < 5.5.17 - Remote Directory Listing 
Apache Tomcat < 6.0.18 - 'utf8' Directory Traversal  
Apache Tomcat < 6.0.18 - 'utf8' Directory Traversal (PoC)
Apache Tomcat < 9.0.1 (Beta) / < 8.5.23 / < 8.0.47 / < 7.0.8 - JSP Upload Bypass / Remote Code Execution (1) 
Apache Tomcat < 9.0.1 (Beta) / < 8.5.23 / < 8.0.47 / < 7.0.8 - JSP Upload Bypass / Remote Code Execution (2)
```  

* I'm gonna try with the first one see if the code is readable to me.
* It's simple but not working :(
* It's not working because I'm looking in the wrong direction and the tomcat version is 9 not 2 which leaves me with no exploits on exploit-db.
* Found an exploit that affects tomcat-catalina version 9.0.31 is affected.
* found these for the tomcat service and found some stuff in the examples directory but no luck with anything so far

* Found this vulnerability. Might be the one but it seems too new (https://www.sangfor.com/en/info-center/blog-center/cyber-security/apache-tomcat-deserialization-remote-code-execution-vulnerability) IRRELEVANT
* Try and look into this one or any other expliots for the apache version because it's quiet old (https://www.virsec.com/research-lab/cve-2020-11984-apache-http-server-2-4-32-to-2-4-44-mod_proxy_uwsgi-info-disclosure-and-possible-rce)

## Nmap Results  
  <img src="https://nmap.org/images/nmap-logo-256x256.png">   

* Initial nmap output  

  ```console
  PORT     STATE SERVICE
  22/tcp   open  ssh
  80/tcp   open  http
  8080/tcp open  http-proxy
  ```

* Full scan gives same results as the 1000 ports nmap scan.

* DNS unauthorized zone transfer.  
* I found an LFI in this url `http://megahosting.htb/news.php?file=../../../../../../../etc/passwd` I was able to read the passwd file and I now know that there's a user called "ash"  
  ```console
  ash:x:1000:1000:clive:/home/ash:/bin/bash 
  ```

* It seems like the config file `tomcat-users.xml` is usually stored in `$CATALINA_HOME\conf\tomcat-users.xml` and the catalina home seems to be in the following dir  `CATALINA_HOME in /usr/share/tomcat9 `, so I will be trying this path `/usr/share/tomcat9/conf/tomcat-users.xml`.
* They say that credentials are usually stored on tomcat config files.  
* I must be able to open some file from the tomcat service in the port 80 service through the LFI vulnerability and this way I can get something. A credential or anything.

## <span style="color:#FF5050">Checklist ü§ì   

- [ ] Maybe I can access data through this path somehow `/var/lib/tomcat9/webapps/ROOT/index.html`
- [x] Try default credentials for `/html/manager` and `/html/host-manager`.
- [ ] Bruteforce the `/html/manager` login credentials.

<br/><br/>


## <span style="color:#FF5050">What Do We Have? ü§îü§î 

* Default credentials that could be the ones  
```
admin:admin
tomcat:tomcat
admin:<NOTHING>
admin:s3cr3t
tomcat:s3cr3t
admin:tomcat
```
