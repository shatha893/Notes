# Chisel


* On my machine I should put the following command `./chisel server -p 8000`.
* On the victim `./chisel client 10.10.14.4:8000 R:80:10.10.11.164:3000`
* Then after I do that you just go and open `http://localhost` on the browser and it will open it. YES!!!!
* It's like using a reverse proxy for port forwarding.
