# SNMP   

## `snmpwalk`  
  * It's the name given to an SNMP application that runs multiple GETNEXT requests automatically.
  * The SNMP GETNEXT request is used to query an enabled device and take SNMP data from a device.
  * The `snmpwalk` command is used because it allows the user to chain GETNEXT requests together without having to enter unique commands for each and every OID or node within a sub-tree.

## `snmpenum`  
  * Can be used to enumerate the service snmp when it's available.
