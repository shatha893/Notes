# OSINT Notes  

* `remove.by` or `cleanup.pictures`. 
* Use "bing" for reverse image search.  
* How to get the geolocation of an image or video
    * By doing a reverse image search. 
        * It's worth it to crop the image if we didn't get accurate results in the reverse image search
        * Google images (It's not really good for image searching), bing, TinEye (It's results aren't as good as the others), and Yandix.
        * We can use an add-on to speedup the process of reverse image searching.
        * The GPS data of an image is usually embedded inside its exif data (Most of the time we won't find it and it could also be edited and changed so we can't just trust the data that we find). 
        * All big social media websites strip the exif data from an image.
