# Questions on General Stuff   

## What is Cryptography?   
* It's a practice that is used to secure information and data from those who are not supposed to get access to such data.  
* Maybe we can also say that it's the process of converting plain text into cipher text so that it can be protected from those who are not supposed to access it.

## What is the difference between Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption?    

* Symmetric  
  * Encryption Key: Same key for encryption and decryption.
  * Performance: Encryption is faster but more vulnerable.  
  * Algorithms: DES, 3DES, AES and RC4.  
  * Purpose: Used for bulk data transmission.

* Asymmetric   
  * Encryption Key: Different keys for encryption & decryption  
  * Performance: Encryption is due to high computation.  
  * Algorithms: Diffie-Hellman, RSA.  
  * Purpose: Often used for securely exchanging secret keys.   

## What is the difference between IDS and IPS?  

* IDS (Intrusion Detection System): it only detects intrusions and the administrator has to take care of preventing the intrusion.  
* IPS (Intrusion Prevention System): the system detects the intrusion and also takes action to prevent the intrusion.

* What is the difference between IPSes and firewalls?   !!!!!!!!!

## Explain the CIA triad   

* Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability.
* The CIA is a model that is designed to guide policies for Information Security.
* It's one of the most popular models used by organizations.  
* Confidentiality: the information should be accessible and readable only to authorized personnel. It should not be accessible by unauthorized personnel. The information should be strongly encrypted just in case someone uses hacking to access the data so that even if the data is accessed, it is not readable or understandable.
