# The Silent Patient   

Overall I liked the style of the auther and I wasn't bored at all even though it became obvious after a while what was the ending because she kept hinting that the lover Kathy was meeting is somehow familiar to Theo and the story kind of started to fit together 

How there was a man standing outside 
How Theo wanted revenge for his wife's betrayal
How Alicia clearly didn't do it alone

How she depected Gabriel as this perfect man which he was not even near to it

I liked the ending I thought it was realistic to a certain level
There was no evil and good just humans that all make mistakes and have a reason for it even if what they believe in doesn't make sense to some it made sense to them

It became a bit not exciting while I went through the book I'm not sure why I just thought the part where alicia was silent was a tad boring

The ending is satisfying

The moment her cousin said "This is where the scene happened" this is where alicia's father killed her I was like NO WAY for a second I thought I'm in a mr robot episode and that Alicia is the one who's dead not her father and that somehow theo is the one in therapy and all of them were trying to cure him by getting him to face the facts 

Or I had another theory where Alicia and Kathy are the same person and also Theo was the one in therapy

My mind kept going to the explanation that theoy was the one who's insane but until the last 100 pages when I connected the dots and everything started to make sense.

So do you think it's a good step that now I have a penetration testing job that I take OSCP? Because I was thinking of taking OSCP so that I could get an entry level job but now I'm thinking maybe that's not wise.
Because I feel like the way of thinking for an OSCP is to rely on myself with everything without any automation tools or metasploit or Nessus

It's, like, kteer different iltaree2a elle real pen testing happens than what OSCP puts you through.
Fa in your opinion do you think I should still take the OSCP or look for another certificate that could benefit me more? because halla2 seret second guessing my decisions.
